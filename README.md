Android Tic Tac Toe
===========

This is an Android app that uses my Java Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe engine.

It can be built and played locally either through an emulator or on your personal android device.

Opening in Android Studio
==
[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html)

First clone the repository into the directory of your choosing. Then open Android Studio and select Import Project. When prompted to select a file, go to the directory you cloned the app into, and then select the gradle.build file. This will build the app into the IDE.

Run on Emulator
==
After importing the app into Android Studio, you can run the app on the emulator by going to the run menu and selecting run App. This will build the app and run it on your emulator.

If you have not set up your emulator, [Google has a guide](http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/index.html) on setting one up. If you are finding that your emulator is running slowly, I have a [blog post](http://jakenations.me/2014/09/26/how-to-make-the-android-emulator-faster/) on speeding it up!

Run on Device

Google has a guide on how to properly load the app onto your phone in a debugging environment, and that can be found [Here](http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html)
